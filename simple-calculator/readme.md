## Problem statement

Write a program to perform simple arithmetic operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo (remainder)

### Input

    Enter first number: <Input first number here>
    Enter second number: <Input second number here>
    Choose operation from + - * / % : <Choose operation from the list>

### Output

    For + operation output should be addition of first and second numbers
    For - operation output should be subtraction of first and second numbers
    For * operation output should be multiplication of first and second number
    For / operation output should be division of first number by second number. If the second number is zero, it should display the message 'cannot divide by zero'
    For % operation output should be remainder of first number divided by second number expression. If the second number is zero, it should display the message 'cannot divide by zero'
    For any invalid operation output should be 'invalid operation'
