If the answer to any of the above question is yes, then you are at the right place, my friend.

**Show Me The Code** is a one stop (forever free) shop for developers to understand and solve different programming challenges in collaboration with community members. Although primarily targeted for students and beginner level developers, hope this repository helps everyone to improve their programming skills in general, understand different programming languages with their features and gotchas(!), multiple ways to solve a problem with pros and cons, get comfortable with git and GitHub (yes, they are different!), feel part of the community and have fun!

Okay enough reading, lets write some code...
